## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board
- WS2812B LED strip (default 60 LEDs)
- Power supply for LED strip

## Pin Configuration

| Component | GPIO Pin | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| LED Strip | 17 | Data line for WS2812B |

##  Quick Start

### Option 1: Flash Pre-built Firmware (Recommended for Users)

**No Arduino IDE or coding required!** Just flash the firmware directly to your ESP32.

#### Step 1: Download Firmware
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/NASA-0007/MavenLED-Bambu-Lab-Status-LED/releases)
2. Download the latest `MavenLED_vX.X.X.bin` file

#### Step 2: Flash to ESP32
1. Visit **[ESP Tool Web Flasher](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/)** in Chrome or Edge browser
2. Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB
3. Click **"Connect"** and select your ESP32's COM port
4. Click **"Choose File"** and select the downloaded `.bin` file
5. Set **Flash Address** to `0x0`
6. Click **"Program"**
7. Wait for the flashing process to complete (usually 30-60 seconds)
8. Click **"Disconnect"** and reset your ESP32

> **Note**: For detailed troubleshooting, see [INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md)

#### Step 3: Initial Setup
1. Power on your ESP32
2. Connect to the WiFi network `MavenLED-Setup` (password: `mavenled123`)
3. Your browser should open automatically to the setup page (or go to `http://192.168.4.1`)
4. Configure your WiFi and printer MQTT settings
5. Device will restart and connect to your network

---

### Option 2: Build from Source (For Developers)
1. Connect WS2812B LED strip data line to **GPIO 17**
2. Connect appropriate power supply to LED strip (5V, capacity depends on LED count)
3. Flash the ESP32 with the MavenLED firmware

### Software Installation

#### Prerequisites
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (1.8.x or later) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- ESP32 board support installed

#### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
